## My collection of educational resources

### What is this about?

This repository is what hopefully grows into a collection of educational resources for computing in the life sciences with a focus on computational chemistry and drug discovery. I intend to add content based on a loose schedule, which means that content is added as soon as I start to dive into something new that catches my interest

The contents of this repository are coded in Python and presented using ipython notebooks. The idea is that one can work through a section of theory in the notebook and then directly start to experiment with ready-to-run code.

### Installation

There is nothing special needed for installation, except Python and jupyter. If special packages are required, they will be listed in the ipython notebooks or a .yml file will be provided. One thing that makes for a nicer appearance are the LaTex notebook extensions. It is easy to install them, just install the jupyter_contrib_nbextensions package:

`conda install -c conda-forge jupyter_contrib_nbextensions`

then navigate to Nbextensions in an open jupyter-notebook session and check the box 'LaTeX environments for Jupyter'. That's it.
